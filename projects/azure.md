# Azure Notes

## Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by Microsoft Azure. It’s designed for applications that need high performance, low latency, and global scalability.

1. Global distribution – You can replicate your data across multiple Azure regions with just a few clicks, ensuring high availability and low latency worldwide.

2. Multi-model support – Cosmos DB supports several data models:
    1. Document (using APIs like MongoDB or SQL API)
    2. Key-value (Table API)
    3. Graph (Gremlin API)
    4. Column-family (Cassandra API)
3. Automatic scaling – It can automatically scale throughput (measured in Request Units per second, RU/s) based on your app’s workload.

4. Guaranteed performance – Microsoft provides Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for latency, throughput, availability, and consistency.

5. Five consistency levels – From strong to eventual, letting you balance performance and accuracy based on your app’s needs.

#### Common Use Cases

1. Real-time personalization (e.g., recommendation systems)
2. IoT data ingestion and analytics
3. E-commerce product catalogs
4. Mobile or gaming backends with global users
